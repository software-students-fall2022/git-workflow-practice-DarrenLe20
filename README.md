What I find interesting about the article is how it touches on the different important aspects of programming and software engineering that are often glossed over or neglected in education. The article reinforces importance of various programming practices that a developer needs to uphold, which is useful for all new software engineers.

I definitely resonate with what the author said about modeling a program in a way that it is easy to understand. I can recall numerous instances where I would reread my code or someone else's code and not understand anything that was going on! In addition, I think it is important to add a lot of comments when coding, so others can have a better time understanding what you are trying to do.

What I have struggled with in the past is indeed commenting and naming identifiers in my code in a coherent way. Often times, my code would balloon out of control simply because the identifiers for classes or methods are too long or the descriptions for various blocks of the program are too long. I think that self-documenting is an important part of software engineering because when it is done efficiently, it can significantly reduce the time and effort needed to build a successful program.
